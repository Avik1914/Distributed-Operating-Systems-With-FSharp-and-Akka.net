                                            Project 1 
            An interesting problem in arithmetic with deep implications to elliptic curve
            theory is the problem of finding perfect squares that are sums of consecutive
            squares. A classic example is the Pythagorean identity:
            32 + 42 = 52 (1)
            that reveals that the sum of squares of 3, 4 is itself a square. A more interesting
            example is Lucasâ€˜ Square Pyramid:
            12 + 22 + ... + 242 = 702 (2)
            In both of these examples, sums of squares of consecutive integers form the
            square of another integer.
            The goal of this first project is to use F# and the actor model to build a
            good solution to this problem that runs well on multi-core machines.


            Ex1: n = 3, k = 2
                Output: 3

            Ex2: n = 40, k = 24
               Output: 1, 9, 20, 25
